Cloney Island is a greenfield development project aiming to clone much of the functionality and design of Airbnb's platform. Some of the tasks included are as follows:

  * Meeting with an instructor to mimic a client and development team interaction
  * Test Driven Development
  * Tracking workflow on Pivatol Tracker
  * Supporting multitenancy
  * Using OAuth for user authentication
  * Creating a rake task that loads enough objects to create a somewhat realistic scale for production
  * Serving up an internal API
  * Using Javascript to update pages dynamically
  * Incorporating Twilio
  * Incorporating Action Cable to create real-time messaging

This project was developed by a group of 5 developers over a 10 day sprint. The project will be handed off to another team of 5 once completed for another 10 day, round 2 sprint. The second group will add onto functionality as they see fit.
